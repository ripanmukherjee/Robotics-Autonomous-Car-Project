## OpenCV on Ubuntu 18.04 & Raspberry Pi

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source computer vision library and has bindings for C++, Python, and Java. It is used for a very wide range of applications, including medical image analysis, stitching street view images, surveillance video, detecting and recognizing faces, tracking moving objects, extracting 3D models, and much more. OpenCV can take advantage of multi-core processing and features GPU acceleration for real-time operation.

###Install OpenCV from the Ubuntu Repository

The OpenCV package is available from the Ubuntu 18.04 distribution repository. At the time of writing, the version in the repositories is 3.2, which is not the latest version.
To install OpenCV from the Ubuntu 18.04 repositories, follow these steps:

01. Refresh the packages index and install the OpenCV package by typing:

```
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install python3-opencv
```

02. To verify the installation, import the cv2 module and print the OpenCV version:  

```
$ python3 -c "import cv2; print(cv2.__version__)"
```

### Installing OpenCV from the Source

Building the OpenCV library from source is the recommended way of installing OpenCV. It will be optimized for your particular system and you will have complete control over the build options.
To install the latest OpenCV version from the source, perform the following steps:

01. Install the required dependencies:

```
$ sudo apt install build-essential cmake git pkg-config libgtk-3-dev \
    libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev libv4l-dev \
    libxvidcore-dev libx264-dev libjpeg-dev libpng-dev libtiff-dev \
    gfortran openexr libatlas-base-dev python3-dev python3-numpy \
    libtbb2 libtbb-dev libdc1394-22-dev
```

02. Clone the OpenCVâ€™s and OpenCV contrib repositories:

```
$ mkdir ~/opencv_build && cd ~/opencv_build
$ git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv.git
$ git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib.git
```

At the time of writing, the default version in the github repositories is version 4.2.0. If you want to install an older version of OpenCV, cd to both opencv and opencv_contrib directories and run git checkout <opencv-version>

03. Once the download is complete, create a temporary build directory, and switch to it:

```
$ cd ~/opencv_build/opencv
$ mkdir build && cd build
```

04. Set up the OpenCV build with CMake:

```
$ cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE \
    -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local \
    -D INSTALL_C_EXAMPLES=ON \
    -D INSTALL_PYTHON_EXAMPLES=ON \
    -D OPENCV_GENERATE_PKGCONFIG=ON \
    -D OPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH=~/opencv_build/opencv_contrib/modules \
    -D BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON ..
```

05. Start the compilation process:

```
$ make -j8
```

06. Install OpenCV with:

```
$ sudo make install
```

07. To verify whether OpenCV has been installed successfully, type the following command and you should see the OpenCV version:

```
$ pkg-config --modversion opencv4
$ python3 -c "import cv2; print(cv2.__version__)"
```
