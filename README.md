## Description
This study implements an Arduino obstacle avoidance car including Bluetooth and Wi-fi control and Robotic gripper. The car can be used as Image & Video processing with Neural Network and Deep Learning concept with Python + OpenCV. The L298N is used as the driving circuit, the PWM output from the Arduino is used for speed control, and the infrared sensor is used to emit infrared rays at a certain frequency to detect obstacles, and all the detection signals are sent to the Arduino. The Arduino acts as a control core to change the speed and steering of the car to achieve automatic obstacle avoidance. The Raspberry Pi 3 and Pi cam is used as operating system for Image and Video Processing.
